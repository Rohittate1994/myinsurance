<!-- Observables:
	Observables are asynchronous or parellal flow of execution which can handle the multiple events at a time.
	Observables came from angular libraries i.e. RxJS.
	Observables always recieve the stream of data. like 1,2,3,4,5,6.......
	Observables can handle three events :
	next(), complete(), error().
	Observables can handle the errors.
	Observables can be cancellable. 
	Observables are used to get the data from backend.
	
	
Subscription:
	Converting http response (i.e. in the form of observables) into normal readable format data is called as Subscription.
	Until and unless we subscribe the data we will not able to get the data at UI end.
	We can pass callback or anonymous function to the subscribe method.
	Normally we pass two callback methods i.e. with params response and error.
RxJS Operators:

* There are two types of operators i.e. unicast operators and multicast operators.
	Unicast operators are used to recieve the data and send to next block like from, of, map, filter, pipe.
	Multicast operators are used to recieve the data and send to next block as well as they are having capability of holding the data.
	Multicast operators are also called as RxJS special operators.
	We have two operators as an multicast operators i.e. Subject and Behaviour subject.
	
1. from: Used to convert normal array data into observables.

2. of: Used to convert normal comma seperated values into observables.

3. map : Used to convert data into new observables.

4. filter: Used to filter the data based on condition and will return new observables.

5. pipe: Can combine multiple operators at a time like map, filter -->
